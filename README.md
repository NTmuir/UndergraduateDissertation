## Undergraduate Dissertation
All the code used for FFT analysis, EDM bearing life calculations and EDM circuitry simulations 
Customer FEA data has been redacted to NDA

# Key ideas
Using 2D analysis to put a point of dynamic loading on the races of the bearing can emulate the effect of a pitted face in ANSYS (below)

Then performing FFT analysis from frequency response output ANSYS gave the key frequency peaks

The displacement measured from FEA was applied to different theortical effective air gaps to determine the torque variation
